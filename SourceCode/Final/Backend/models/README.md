# Code Ownership:
Ask Swathi or Brandon before changing.

# More Information:
* Please alert brandon to any changes made to any of these files!

# TODOs:
* naming consistency?
* Kristen should be able to specify if a requirement requires a link to be provided by the Influencer when they are completing it.
* Why is there only one “requirement” element in product.js? Why is “requirements” commented out (that should solve the first issue).
